q1:

  > A library in javascript is a collection of pre-written functions or modules that provide specific functionalities. developers
  can selectively use these functions in their applications. for example: the Lodash library provides utility functions like 
  sorting arrays or manipulating strings.
  > But a framework in javascript is a more comprehensive structure that includes libraries, tools, and conventions to build 
  applications. it dictates the overall architecture and flow of an application. developers must follow the framework structure 
  and conventions. an example is AngularJS, which provides a complete framework for building dynamic web applications.
  > Libraries offer flexibility and allow developers to extend or modify their functionality. for example: the Axios library 
  provides an easy way to make HTTP requests and can be customized with interceptors for authentication or error handling.
  
  > React is a popular library that provides a component-based architecture for building user interfaces. developers provide 
  components and let React handle rendering and updating the UI. in some places though, React is considered as a framework because
  of its power and influence.

q3:

  JSX is a HTML-like markup stuff used in react components render section and the purpose of using them is to improve readability
  and maintainability of components; also JSX makes it easy to see the structure and hierarchy of our components, as well as the 
  props and state that they rely on. This can make it easier to understand and maintain our code, especially as our application 
  grows in complexity. It provides a more readable and intuitive way to write component code by allowing developers to mix HTML-like tags
  and JavaScript expressions within the same file. This makes it easier for developers, including learners, to understand and work with
  React components.
  and the last point is that JSX is not a requirement for using React. it only simplifies creating Virtual DOM elements that was used to
  be created using React.createElement method.

q4:

  Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They usually represent a self-contained and independent part of the UI in the page.
  They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML. they usually have some state containing the
  current situation and state of the component; and also they can give a props object containing the data that is passed to from parent 
  component indicating the initial configuration of the component.
  Components come in two types, Class-based components and Functional components.
